# Forecast Is Changing

In early April 2020, [Apple announced that it has purchased Dark Sky](https://blog.darksky.net/) and making the platform exclusive to it's ecosystem. Because of this, the API that Forecast relies on will only function until the end of 2021.

> For this reason,  
> Forecast will not function as it currently does past 2021

I will attempt to keep the bot active for as long as possible and am investigating a weather API alternative to [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/).

Thankyou for your feedback, support and for using Forecast!
